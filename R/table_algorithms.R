#' Generate a Summary Table of Algorithms
#'
#' This function creates a pre-specified summary table of the probable PDD
#' algorithms compared in the study. It is intended as a shortcut to insert
#' a clean table into a Quarto document without cluttering the main text.
#' The table content is hard-coded and can only be changed by modifying the
#' function code.
#'
#' @param vars A data.frame, tibble, or matrix with  in the
#'    following order:
#'
#'    1. variable names,
#'    2. variable labels
#'    3. type of variable (continuous, binary, or nominal)
#'    4. optional, group,
#'    5. optional, mapping each label to its description in the tableâ€™s note.
#'
#'    Alternatively, a path to a CSV file (semicolon-delimited) containing
#'    such a table.
#'
#' @returns A \code{gt} table object containing the summary of criteria used in the study.
#'
#' @seealso [gt_apa_table()] is used to format the table.
