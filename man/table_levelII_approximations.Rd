\title{Generate summary table of top and bottom Level I algorithms
in predicting Level II-derived probable PDD}
\usage{
table_levelII_approximations(values, struct, crit)
}
\arguments{
\item{values}{A tibble of concordance statistics generated by
\code{describe_concordance}.}

\item{struct}{A list with two elements:
\describe{
\item{[\link{1}]}{Character vector of Level I algorithm names derived using FAQ total > 7
as the IADL criterion.}
\item{[\link{2}]}{Character vector of Level I algorithm names derived using FAQ item 9 > 1
as the IADL criterion. Note: order matters.}
}}

\item{crit}{A character string indicating which Level II algorithm is used
as the reference for comparison.}
}
\value{
A \code{gt} table object summarising the concordance statistics
(e.g., accuracy, kappa) of the five best and five worst Level I algorithms
in predicting the specified Level II-based diagnosis of probable PDD.
}
\description{
This helper function prepares a table showing the five best and
five worst-performing Level I algorithms in predicting a selected
Level II-based diagnosis of probable PDD. It is primarily intended
for use in the manuscript to keep Quarto documents uncluttered.
