\title{Compute and visualise measures of concordance between diagnostic criteria}
\usage{
describe_concordance(d0, vars)
}
\arguments{
\item{d0}{A list containing PDD diagnostic results, as produced by
\code{diagnose_pdd_sample}.}
}
\value{
A list with two components:
\describe{
\item{\code{stats}}{A data frame summarising pairwise concordance statistics
(e.g., Kappa, Accuracy, Sensitivity, Specificity, PPV, NPV).}
\item{\code{plots}}{A list of ggplot2-based visualisations, including matrices
of Cohen's Kappa, Accuracy (with significance tests against the No Information Rate),
Sensitivity, and Specificity.}
}
}
\description{
Computes pairwise concordance statistics between different operationalisations
of probable Parkinsonâ€™s disease dementia (PDD). Metrics include Cohen's Kappa,
Sensitivity, Positive Predictive Value (PPV), Specificity, Negative Predictive
Value (NPV), and Accuracy. Visual summaries are also generated.
