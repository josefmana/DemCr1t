 abstract={&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Item response theory (IRT) is widely applied in the human sciences to model persons’ responses on a set of items measuring one or more latent constructs. While several R packages have been developed that implement IRT models, they tend to be restricted to respective pre-specified classes of models. Further, most implementations are frequentist while the availability of Bayesian methods remains comparably limited. I demonstrate how to use the R package brms together with the probabilistic programming language Stan to specify and fit a wide range of Bayesian IRT models using flexible and intuitive multilevel formula syntax. Further, item and person parameters can be related in both a linear or non-linear manner. Various distributions for categorical, ordinal, and continuous responses are supported. Users may even define their own custom response distribution for use in the presented framework. Common IRT model classes that can be specified natively in the presented framework include 1PL and 2PL logistic models optionally also containing guessing parameters, graded response and partial credit ordinal models, as well as drift diffusion models of response times coupled with binary decisions. Posterior distributions of item and person parameters can be conveniently extracted and postprocessed. Model fit can be evaluated and compared using Bayes factors and efficient cross-validation procedures.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;},

  abstract = {Abstract Background Diagnostic labels, such as cognitively normal, mild cognitive impairment, and dementia rely on application of several different criteria and are often based at least in part on subjective clinical judgments. These factors may lead to heterogeneity in diagnostic practices across datasets. A modern psychometric technique known as item response theory (IRT) can be used to take information from many different markers of an underlying spectrum (e.g., cognitive impairment) and evaluate how diagnostic labels perform across datasets when shared items are used. Method In this poster, we illustrate how IRT might be used to evaluate how diagnostic labels function across two major databases of older adults that include cognitive data and diagnostic labels, the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center Uniform Data Set (n = 6,042) and the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (n = 513). Result Taking an IRT driven Cochran-Mantel-Haenzel approach revealed no significant differential item functioning for the diagnostic labels among individuals from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center databases (Figure 2; X2 =11.79, p < .001, Class AA item characterization). Conclusion The current study demonstrated how IRT scoring approaches outline similarities in cognitive functioning across a group of measures, despite being diagnosed under different criteria across studies. Findings illustrate a manner of evaluating if diagnostic labels are applied correctly across participants. The utility of this approach will be tempered by the ability to identify underlying unidimensional constructs across studies, although multi-dimensional IRT approaches have been developed.},
