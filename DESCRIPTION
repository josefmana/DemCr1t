Description: This package is not intended for public use. The idea is to provide a documentation
    behind data analysis that serves as a backbone of the empirical part of the paper
    Mana et al. (under review)^[Will be updated once the manuscript is accepted for
    publication.]. Furthermore, if we are able to share some of the data in the future, we will use
    this package to document processes that can be used to reproduce our results (since
    sharing raw patients data is out of question due to privacy concerns, the pre-processing
    pipeline presented here will be functional only on data owner's computer at the First
    Faculty of Medicine, Charles University).
